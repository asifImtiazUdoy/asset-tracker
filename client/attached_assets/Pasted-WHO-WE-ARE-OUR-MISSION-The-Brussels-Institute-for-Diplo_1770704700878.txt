The Brussels Institute for Diplomacy, Geopolitics and Peace Studies organizes Strategic
Dialogues to serve as a neutral and credible platform where policymakers, experts, and
stakeholders can engage on pressing issues in foreign policy, security, and peace.
These dialogues are essential for the following reasons
Facilitate High-Level Policy Coordination:
High-level policy dialogues bring together senior officials, ambassadors, and
institutional leaders to discuss strategic challenges.
They enable participants to share perspectives, align policies, and identify
collaborative solutions in complex and rapidly evolving international environments.
Such engagement strengthens transatlantic, multilateral, and regional cooperation
on key security and governance issues.
Promote Knowledge Exchange and Expertise
Expert roundtables convene leading practitioners, academics and analysts to discuss
emerging geopolitical and security trends.
These sessions foster critical thinking, innovative solutions, and the dissemination of
best practices.
They create opportunities for cross-sector learning and the integration of diverse
viewpoints into policy design.
Support Confidential Discussion and Decision-Making
Closed-door briefings and strategic consultations provide a safe space for sensitive
deliberations.
They facilitate honest, candid dialogue, enabling policymakers to explore options and
anticipate challenges without public or political pressures.
These forums support informed, coordinated and timely decision-making in
multilateral and bilateral contexts.
Address Emerging Strategic Challenges
Public–private strategic exchanges examine the role of technology companies,
critical infrastructure providers, and other emerging actors in global politics.
These dialogues ensure policymakers understand how non-state actors, disruptive
technologies and digital platforms affect security, diplomacy and governance.
They strengthen the capacity of states and international institutions to navigate
complex, technology-driven strategic environments.
By organizing Strategic Dialogues, the Institute enhances coordination, trust, and shared
understanding among multilateral and transatlantic actors. These engagements
contribute to evidence-based policymaking, effective diplomacy, and sustainable peace,
while also addressing the evolving challenges posed by emerging technologies and
non-state geopolitical actors.
