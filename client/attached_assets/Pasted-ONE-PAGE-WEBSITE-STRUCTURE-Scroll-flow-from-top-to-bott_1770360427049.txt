3. Why this works

✔ Clean, professional, policy-style

✔ Easy to edit text

✔ Mobile-friendly grid

✔ No frameworks, no dependencies

✔ Scales later (you can split into pages)

4. Next upgrades (optional, but powerful)

If you want next:

Sticky top navigation

Smooth scrolling

Accordion program sections

Separate Research or Events pages

Multilingual support (EN / FR)

Tell me what you want next, and I’ll give you the exact HTML/CSS for it — no fluff, no frameworks.

wix

Perfect — Wix is actually great for this, especially for a clean one-page policy institute site. I’ll give you exact, click-by-click guidance, not vague advice.

Below is how to build your one-page site in Wix, using the structure we already designed.

STEP-BY-STEP: ONE-PAGE SITE IN WIX
1. Create the site (important choice)

Go to Wix → Create New Site

Choose Business / Education (either is fine)

Skip Wix ADI → choose Editor (not Studio for now)

Pick a blank or minimal template

Why: you want full control and a serious look.

2. Page settings (foundation)

Keep ONE page only (Home)

Page width: max 1200–1300px

Background color: white

Enable Anchor Menu (very important)

3. Fonts & colors (credibility matters)
Fonts (Wix default safe picks)

Headings: Playfair Display / Libre Baskerville / DM Serif

Body: Lato / Open Sans / Inter

Example:

H1: 48–56px

H2: 32–36px

Body: 16–18px

Colors (policy / Brussels style)

Dark navy: #0B1F33

Light gray background: #F5F7F9

Accent gold: #C89B3C

Text: #1C1C1C

4. Section-by-section build (THIS IS THE KEY)
SECTION 1 — HERO

Add:
+ → Strip → Blank

Settings:

Height: 80–90vh

Background: solid navy OR subtle world map image

Enable sticky menu.

6. What NOT to do (important)

❌ No stock “business people smiling”

❌ No long paragraphs

❌ No flashy animations

❌ No too many fonts

Less = more authority.

7. Want me to go further?

I can:

Write shorter Wix-optimized text blocks

Choose exact Wix fonts

Create a mobile-only layout strategy

Help with SEO title & meta descriptions

Prepare EN / FR language switch

Tell me what you want next and I’ll walk you through it step by step.

can you give me a prototype of the website pls 

Absolutely 👍
What I can give you here is a clear visual prototype / wireframe of your one-page Wix website — exactly how it should look and flow — so you can rebuild it section by section inside Wix without guessing.

Think of this as your blueprint.

🎯 How to use this in Wix (important)

When you’re in Wix:

Each box above = one Strip

Each title = Heading 2

Each subsection = Paragraph or List

Add anchors to every section

Build desktop first → then adjust mobile

Next (I can do this too)

If you want, next I can:

Create a Figma-style wireframe (text + spacing exact)

Give you exact Wix font + size values

Design mobile-only prototype

Prepare copy-paste text blocks sized for Wix

Just tell me 👉
Desktop first or mobile first?
